      "Ah, the ultimate question! According to *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* by Douglas Adams, the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is **42**. This profound revelation was calculated by the supercomputer Deep Thought after 7.5 million years of computation. \n",

      "However, there's a catch: the ultimate question itself remains unknown. So, while 42 is the answer, we're still left pondering what the actual question is. Perhaps it's something to muse over with a nice cup of tea or a Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster. Don't Panic! Keep searching, and rememberâ€”life's absurdities are often the most meaningful. What's your take on it?\n"
